NAME
weka.classifiers.trees.J48

SYNOPSIS
Class for generating a pruned or unpruned C4.5 decision tree. For more information, see

Ross Quinlan (1993). C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning. Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, San Mateo, CA.

OPTIONS
debug -- If set to true, classifier may output additional info to the console.

batchSize -- The preferred number of instances to process if batch prediction is being performed. More or fewer instances may be provided, but this gives implementations a chance to specify a preferred batch size.

numDecimalPlaces -- The number of decimal places to be used for the output of numbers in the model.

minNumObj -- The minimum number of instances per leaf.

confidenceFactor -- The confidence factor used for pruning (smaller values incur more pruning).

binarySplits -- Whether to use binary splits on nominal attributes when building the trees.

seed -- The seed used for randomizing the data when reduced-error pruning is used.

numFolds -- Determines the amount of data used for reduced-error pruning.  One fold is used for pruning, the rest for growing the tree.

doNotMakeSplitPointActualValue -- If true, the split point is not relocated to an actual data value. This can yield substantial speed-ups for large datasets with numeric attributes.

saveInstanceData -- Whether to save the training data for visualization.

unpruned -- Whether pruning is performed.

doNotCheckCapabilities -- If set, classifier capabilities are not checked before classifier is built (Use with caution to reduce runtime).

subtreeRaising -- Whether to consider the subtree raising operation when pruning.

collapseTree -- Whether parts are removed that do not reduce training error.

useMDLcorrection -- Whether MDL correction is used when finding splits on numeric attributes.

useLaplace -- Whether counts at leaves are smoothed based on Laplace.

reducedErrorPruning -- Whether reduced-error pruning is used instead of C.4.5 pruning.
